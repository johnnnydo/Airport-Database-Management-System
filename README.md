Developed a Python application for managing and interacting with a SQLite database within a tkinter interface. Creating this project which the goal to become familar with SQL queries and how to mitigate SQL injection risks by sanitizing user inputs and using parameterized queries. I leveraged knowledge of database schema and constraints to handle NULL values effectively in the user interface and utilized incremental development and testing approaches, regularly committing code to a Git repository.
